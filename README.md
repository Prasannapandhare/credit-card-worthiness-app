## 📍 **Project Overview**
This web application empowers users to predict their credit card worthiness by inputting financial and personal details. Built with a robust machine learning model trained on comprehensive datasets, the app ensures accurate and reliable predictions. The project uses Flask for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, incorporating Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model building. 
- Discover your credit worthiness with our sophisticated prediction tool designed to deliver precise results.

### 🚀 Introduction
The Credit Card Worthiness Prediction App uses a machine learning model to assess the creditworthiness of individuals. The model is trained on various financial and personal data points to provide an accurate prediction. Ideal for credit scoring and financial risk assessment.
